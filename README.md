# ✨ Chien-Pao ✨
Welcome to my profile! I'm Chien-Pao, also known as Magestick, a beginner programmer or just, a tester/graphic designer.

* 💻 I'm looking for anyone who can help with the coding.
* 👀 I'm mostly interested in coding, robotics, and making game mods.
* ⚡ And yes, don't ask me to help you with something, you should help me instead.

### About me
* 💬 Bilingual (Russian/English)
  * While I read and write English perfectly, I'm too shy to speak it.
  * I speak Russian as my native language, only in real.

I forgor what to write next... Maybe later.
